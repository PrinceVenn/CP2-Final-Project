# Northern Lights

## Artist Statement

### With this piece, Koda Bryant combines his need for stimulation of the senses and his desire to explore and experiment with new and challenging medias. His work involves taking a simple idea and recreating it so that it may be physically interacted with and gives the viewer a chance to be aesthetically pleased.

My idea for this project was to create a glove that featured lights and could be interacted with in someway.
