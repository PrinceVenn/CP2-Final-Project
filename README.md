# Northern Lights

## Artist Statement

### With this piece, Koda Bryant combines his need for stimulation of the senses and his desire to explore and experiment with new and challenging medias. His work involves taking a simple idea and recreating it so that it may be physically interacted with and gives the viewer a chance to be aesthetically pleased.

My idea for this project was to create a glove that featured lights and could be interacted with in someway. 

## Summary

For my final project, I wanted to work with sewable electronics and keep my idea as simple as possible to assure that I would be able to get it done on time. I had a lot of ideas that I ulitimetly simpled down until I ended up with my final. My first idea was to create a full body suit that would be covered in neo-pixels and was light sensative and reactive, but I figured that would be too much and I would run out of time, materials, and money. I decided against using a light sensor, since I had attempted to use it in a previous project with not great results, and ended up going with a motion/direction sensor that I had never used before. I changed it to just two formfitting gloves, then to one glove after some technical difficulties later in the semester. I ended up not being able to use the sensor that I included, but I was able to get the neopixels, wiring and code working, so I still count it as a success.

## Challenges

The coding was the hardest part for me, since I was basicly trying to blend two different codes together. They would work well sepperately, but they would stop working once I put them together and I spent a lot of time trying to slowly bring them closer. I had to put a lot more time into figuring out the accelerometer's code than the neopixels code though. I also had a challenge using conductive thread even though I am pretty used to it. There were a couple sections where I had to go back and re-sew the pixels in place because thread was coming loose.

## Completed Work

I ended up with one wearable glove that contained 10 neopixels and would flash a series of colors that I picked.
